  <h1>VeriSky Support</h1>
  <p>VeriSky is a weather forecast comparison app that lets you see how accurate predictions really were. Below you'll find answers to common questions.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I switch forecast models?</summary>
    <p>Tap the model name at the top of the timeline screen to see all available models. Selecting a different model updates both the forecast line and the ghost prediction line.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What is the ghost line?</summary>
    <p>The ghost line (dashed) shows what a model predicted 24, 48, or 72 hours ago. It's overlaid on the actual observed weather so you can see how accurate the forecast was.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I change the ghost line timeframe?</summary>
    <p>In Settings, look for the Ghost Day option. You can choose between -24h, -48h, or -72h to compare different prediction windows.</p>
