  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>VeriSky is a weather forecast comparison app. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data VeriSky collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding that data.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>VeriSky stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your saved locations (name and coordinates)</li>
    <li>Verification reports you create (timestamp, location coordinates, forecast values, and your notes)</li>
    <li>Your app preferences (units, chart layers, ghost line settings)</li>
    <li>Cached weather API responses (to reduce network usage)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Location Data</h2>
  <p>VeriSky requests access to your device location only when you choose "Current Location." Your coordinates are used to fetch weather forecasts from third-party weather APIs. Location data is stored locally on your device as part of saved locations and verification reports. VeriSky does not transmit your location to any server we operate.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>VeriSky retrieves weather data from the following third-party APIs. When you request a forecast, your selected location coordinates are sent to these services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://open-meteo.com">Open-Meteo</a> — open-source weather API</li>
    <li><a href="https://stormglass.io">Stormglass</a> — used as a fallback for AIFS model data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them. VeriSky does not share any personal information with these services beyond the location coordinates needed to retrieve forecasts.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally on your device. No data is uploaded to any server we control. We do not operate any backend servers or databases that store your information.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You are in full control of your data. You can delete your verification reports and cached data at any time from the Settings screen. Uninstalling the app removes all stored data from your device.</p>

  <h2>Analytics &amp; Tracking</h2>
  <p>VeriSky does not include any analytics, crash reporting, or advertising SDKs. We do not track your usage or behavior within the app.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>VeriSky does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require account creation or any personal information to function.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us via the app's store listing page.</p>
